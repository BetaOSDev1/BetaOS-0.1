# Project-0.1
A universal OS.

Project41 is a research OS designed to natively run most executable file types, both safely, and securely. This includes, .exe, .msi, .app, .pkg, .bat, .bin, and .dmg. It currently supports all IA32 processors. The code is portable, and is currently being extended to add 64 bit support. From the ground up, we are incorperating DLLs, headers, and frameworks for native app exectution.

The OS is still in the early stages of development. It boots, but other than that, its top secret. More to come later!
